3. **Setup Development Environment**: Follow [06-PROJECT-SETUP-GUIDE.md](./06-PROJECT-SETUP-GUIDE.md) for environment setup
4. **Focus on Current Priority**: Issue #019 - Real-time game client implementation

### For Different Specializations

- **Frontend Developers**: The UI foundation is complete, focus on connecting to game engine
- **Game Developers**: Game engine is 100% complete, focus on real-time integration  
- **Backend Developers**: All backend systems working, focus on optimization and scaling

### Quick Start for Current Priority

The highest-impact work is connecting the working game client UI to the complete game engine:

1. **Review Working Systems**: 
   - Game engine: `packages/game-engine/` (160 tests passing)
   - Game client: `apps/game-client/` (Phaser.js + React working)
   - WebSocket server: `apps/game-server/` (multiplayer infrastructure ready)

2. **Implementation Goal**: 
   - Real-time game state synchronization
   - Interactive card playing and board interaction
   - Turn-based gameplay through WebSocket communication
