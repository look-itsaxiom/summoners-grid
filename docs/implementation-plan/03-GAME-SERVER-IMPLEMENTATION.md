## Core Server Components

### 1. Game Server Orchestrator

**Purpose**: Central coordinator that manages the entire server lifecycle and coordinates all subsystems.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Initialize and configure all server systems
- Manage WebSocket server and HTTP endpoints
- Coordinate matchmaking and game room creation
- Handle server shutdown and cleanup
- Monitor server health and performance

**Implementation Approach**:
```typescript
// Example structure (no implementation)
interface GameServerConfig {
  port: number;
  redisUrl: string;
  apiServerUrl: string;
  maxConcurrentGames: number;
  matchmakingEnabled: boolean;
}

class GameServer {
  private io: Server;
  private connectionManager: ConnectionManager;
  private matchmakingService: MatchmakingService;
  private gameRooms: Map<string, GameRoom>;
  
  public async start(config: GameServerConfig): Promise<void>;
  public async stop(): Promise<void>;
  public getServerStats(): ServerStats;
  
  private setupRoutes(): void;
  private handleConnection(socket: Socket): void;
  private cleanup(): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Design Considerations**:
- Graceful shutdown with active game preservation
- Health check endpoints for load balancers

- Configuration management for different environments

### 2. Game Room Management

**Purpose**: Manage individual game instances, player connections, and game state synchronization.

**Key Features**:
- Isolated game state per room
- Player connection tracking and validation
- Real-time state synchronization
- Spectator support and replay recording

**Implementation Approach**:
```typescript
// Example game room structure
interface GameRoomConfig {
  gameMode: GameMode;
  maxPlayers: number;
  allowSpectators: boolean;
  timeouts: TimeoutConfig;
}

class GameRoom {
  private gameEngine: GameEngine;
  private players: Map<PlayerId, PlayerConnection>;
  private spectators: Set<Socket>;
  private gameState: GameState;
  
  public addPlayer(playerId: string, socket: Socket): Promise<void>;
  public removePlayer(playerId: string): Promise<void>;
  public handlePlayerAction(playerId: string, action: PlayerAction): Promise<void>;
  public broadcastGameState(): void;
  
  private validatePlayerAction(playerId: string, action: PlayerAction): boolean;
  private syncGameState(targetPlayers?: PlayerId[]): void;
  private handleGameEnd(result: GameResult): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Design Considerations**:
- Efficient state delta calculation for network optimization
- Player timeout handling with reconnection grace periods
- Spectator mode with limited state visibility
- Game recording for replay and analysis

### 3. Connection and Session Management

**Purpose**: Handle WebSocket connections, player authentication, and session persistence.

**Key Features**:
- WebSocket connection lifecycle management
- JWT token validation and refresh
- Session persistence across reconnections
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

**Implementation Approach**:
```typescript
// Example connection manager structure
interface PlayerSession {
  playerId: string;
  socketId: string;
  gameRoomId?: string;
  lastActivity: Date;
  connectionState: ConnectionState;
}

class ConnectionManager {
  private sessions: Map<string, PlayerSession>;
  private rateLimiter: RateLimiter;
  
  public handleConnection(socket: Socket): Promise<void>;
  public handleDisconnection(socket: Socket): Promise<void>;
  public validateSession(socket: Socket): Promise<PlayerSession>;
  public updateLastActivity(playerId: string): void;
  
  private authenticatePlayer(token: string): Promise<AuthResult>;
  private cleanupInactiveSessions(): void;
  private handleReconnection(playerId: string, socket: Socket): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Design Considerations**:
- Secure authentication with JWT validation
- Session cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Reconnection handling with state restoration
- Protection against connection abuse

### 4. Matchmaking System

**Purpose**: Match players with similar skill levels and create balanced games.

**Key Features**:
- Skill-based matchmaking with rating system
- Queue management with wait time estimation
- Game mode support (3v3, custom games)
- Party and friend matching

**Implementation Approach**:
```typescript
// Example matchmaking system structure
interface MatchmakingCriteria {
  gameMode: GameMode;
  skillRating: number;
  maxWaitTime: number;
  partyMembers?: PlayerId[];
}

class MatchmakingService {
  private queue: MatchmakingQueue;
  private ratingSystem: RatingSystem;
  
  public joinQueue(playerId: string, criteria: MatchmakingCriteria): Promise<void>;
  public leaveQueue(playerId: string): Promise<void>;
  public processMatchmaking(): Promise<Match[]>;
  
  private findCompatiblePlayers(criteria: MatchmakingCriteria): PlayerId[];
  private createMatch(players: PlayerId[]): Promise<GameRoom>;
  private updateRatings(gameResult: GameResult): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Design Considerations**:
- Fair matching algorithm that balances skill and wait time
- Prevention of rating manipulation and smurfing
- Support for different game modes and formats
- Scalable queue management for high player counts

## Real-time Communication Protocol

### Message Type System

```typescript
// Client to Server Messages
interface ClientMessage {
  type: 'action' | 'chat' | 'ping' | 'leave_game';
  data: ActionData | ChatData | PingData | LeaveData;
  timestamp: number;
  requestId: string;
}

// Server to Client Messages
interface ServerMessage {
  type: 'game_state' | 'action_result' | 'chat' | 'error' | 'pong';
  data: GameStateData | ActionResultData | ChatData | ErrorData | PongData;
  timestamp: number;
  responseId?: string;
}

// Specific message types
interface PlayerActionMessage {
  type: 'action';
  data: {
    action: PlayerAction;
    gameStateHash: string; // For validation
  };
}

interface GameStateUpdateMessage {
  type: 'game_state';
  data: {
    gameState: GameState;
    delta?: GameStateDelta; // Optimization for large states
    turnInfo: TurnInfo;
  };
}
```

### State Synchronization Strategy

**Full State Sync**:
- Send complete game state at turn transitions
- Include hash for validation
- Compressed JSON for network efficiency

**Delta Updates**:
- Send only changed parts during turns
- Optimized for frequent small updates
- Fallback to full sync if deltas fail

**Client Prediction**:
- Allow optimistic client updates
- Rollback mechanism for prediction errors
- Server authority for all final states

## Security and Anti-Cheat

### Server-Side Validation

**Action Validation**:
- All player actions validated against current game state
- Timing validation for turn-based constraints
- Resource and requirement checking
- Rate limiting for action frequency

**State Integrity**:
- Server maintains authoritative game state
- Client state is treated as display only
- Hash validation for state consistency
- Rollback protection against manipulation

### Authentication and Authorization

```typescript
interface AuthMiddleware {
  validateJWT(token: string): Promise<AuthResult>;
  checkGameAccess(playerId: string, gameId: string): Promise<boolean>;
  rateLimitCheck(playerId: string, action: string): Promise<boolean>;
}

class SecurityValidator {
  public validatePlayerAction(
    playerId: string, 
    action: PlayerAction, 
    gameState: GameState
  ): ValidationResult;
  
  public checkActionTiming(action: PlayerAction, gameState: GameState): boolean;
  public validateResourceSpending(action: PlayerAction, playerState: PlayerState): boolean;
  public detectSuspiciousPatterns(playerId: string, actions: PlayerAction[]): SuspicionLevel;
}
```

### Cheat Detection

**Pattern Recognition**:
- Monitor action timing patterns
- Detect impossible reaction times
- Identify repeated suspicious actions
- Track win rate anomalies

**State Manipulation Detection**:
