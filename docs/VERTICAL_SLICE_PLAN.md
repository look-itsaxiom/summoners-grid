- Territory control and building placement
- Quest completion mechanics
- Role advancement trees
- All features from the detailed Play Example

### Technology Stack
- **TypeScript** with modern ES6+ features
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **HTML5/CSS3** with responsive design
- **ES6 Modules** for clean architecture
- **No external frameworks** - pure TypeScript implementation

### Layout Design

The demo features a responsive layout with:
- **Minimal Header**: Only game title for clean presentation
- **Side Player Areas**: Player A (left) and Player B (right) containing:
  - Hand cards with playability indicators
  - Face-down counter cards
  - Buildings in play
  - Active quests
  - Advance deck
- **Central Board**: Scrollable 14x12 grid with territory indicators
- **Game Controls**: Phase management and priority passing
- **Footer**: Demo description and feature highlights
