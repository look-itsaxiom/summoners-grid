- **Role Advancement**: Complex tier progression trees
- **Trading System**: Secure player-to-player exchanges
- **Territory Control**: Board positioning mechanics
- **Equipment System**: Weapons, armor, accessories

#### 👥 User Management
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh token rotation
- **Player Statistics**: Level, experience, rating, game history
- **Social Features**: Friends, friend requests
- **Account Security**: Email verification, ban system

## 📊 Implementation Metrics

### Database Schema
- **15 Core Models**: Complete game entity coverage
- **8 Enums**: Type-safe value constraints
