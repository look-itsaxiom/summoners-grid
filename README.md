- **Frontend**: React, Phaser.js, TypeScript
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Nx, Jest, ESLint, Prettier

## üîê Authentication System

The game features a comprehensive authentication system that provides secure user management:

### Features
- **Secure Registration & Login**: JWT-based authentication with HTTP-only refresh tokens
- **User Profile Management**: Display user stats, level, rating, and game history
- **Protected Routes**: Automatic authentication flow with session persistence
- **Token Management**: Automatic refresh every 30 minutes with fallback handling
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with comprehensive error handling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface matching the game's fantasy theme

### User Interface
- **Login Form**: Username/password authentication with show/hide password toggle
- **Registration Form**: Comprehensive signup with email verification and password strength validation
- **User Profile**: In-game overlay showing user statistics and account management
- **Logout Options**: Single device logout or logout from all devices

The authentication UI automatically appears when users access the game, ensuring secure access to all game features while maintaining a seamless user experience.
