## Critical Path Analysis

The following issues are on the critical path and cannot be delayed:
1. #001 → #002 → #003 (Infrastructure foundation)
2. #004 → #005 → #006 (Data and type foundation)
3. #008 → #009 → #010 (Game engine core)
4. #013 → #014 → #015 → #016 (Game client implementation)
5. #017 → #018 → #019 (Multiplayer foundation)

These form the backbone of the project and should be prioritized for assignment to the strongest developers or given extra attention during planning.
